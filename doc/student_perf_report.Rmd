## Relationship between gender and math grades.

Our goal of this project is to understand if there is a statistically significant difference in the mean final grade for male and female students in the [UCI Student Performance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). This dataset is comprised of the final math grade achieved in secondary education for two Portuguese schools. Each row in the dataset represents a student. There are two columns in this tibble, sex and final_math_grade. Sex is a categorical variable that contains the value `female` and `male`. final_math_grade is a continous variable that ranges from 0-100, based on the percentage earned by a student.

A sample of this dataset is shown below.

```{r, include=FALSE}
student_math_perf <- read_csv('../data/clean-student-math-perf.csv')
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
head(student_math_perf)
```

More information about the two columns are summarized below. There are 395 students present in this dataset. The final math grade is primarily concentrated between 40%-70%, with a mean of 52%. 

```{r, include=TRUE}
summary(student_math_perf)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```
