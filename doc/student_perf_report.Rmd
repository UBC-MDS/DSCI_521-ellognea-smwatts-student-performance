## The relationship between gender and math grades

Our goal of this project is to understand if there is a statistically significant difference in the mean final grade for male and female students in the [UCI Student Performance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). This dataset is comprised of the final math grade achieved in secondary education for two Portuguese schools. This question was chosen because it explores the area of research surrounding the gender gap in STEM. Researchers such as Wharton's health care management professor Ashley Swanson have cited that the gender gap for performance in secondary school mathematics is a leading cause for the gender gap in pay. This supports the need for research in this area (Knowledge @ Wharton, 2018).

## The data

Each row in the UCI Student Performance dataset represents a student. There are two columns in this dataset that will be analyzed, sex and final_math_grade. Sex is a categorical variable that contains the values `female` and `male`. final_math_grade is a continuous variable that ranges from 0-100, based on the final grade percentage earned by a student.

```{r, include=FALSE}
student_math_perf <- read_csv('../data/clean-student-math-perf.csv')
```

```

There are 395 students present in this dataset, 208 are female and 187 are male. The distribution of final math grades are shown below. Female students are more highly concentrated around the 50% range than male students. There are also more female students who scored 0% in their math class (23 female vs. 15 male). Only male students have scored the top grade of 100%. However, overall the distributions are similar in shape, with final math grades primarily concentrated between 45 to 70 percent and an overall mean grade of 52 percent.

The mean final math grade achieved by female students is 49.8%, whereas the mean final math grade achieved by male students is 54.6%. This is shown in the following figure, which provides these sample estimates and the confidence intervals by gender.

### Findings

To determine if there was a statistically significant difference in the mean math grade for male and female students a null and an alternative hypothesis was defined.

$H_0:$ mean of female student math grades = mean of male student math grades

$H_A:$ mean of female student math grades $\neq$ mean of male student math grades

The null hypothesis is that the mean math grade for male and female students is equal, whereas the alternative hypothesis is that they are not. Since the distributions are similar, a two tail test was selected. Additionally, a Welch t-test was selected because the samples have unequal variances.

```{r, include=FALSE}
t_test <- read_csv('../results/t-test_results.csv')
t_test <- t_test %>% select(method, alternative, p.value)
```

Table 2: Hypothesis test results for $H_0:$ mean of female student math grades = mean of male student math grades. P-value indicates that gender has a statistically significant result on the mean math grade.
```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(t_test)
```

The resulting p-value from the Welch two sample t-test (which was selected to compare the two means) is 0.039577. To be 95% confident in the findings of this t-test an alpha value of 0.05 is selected. Therefore, since the p-value is less than alpha (at 0.039577), the null hypothesis is rejected. 

Furthering the analysis, when the 38 student outliers who scored 0% in their final math grade are dropped from the dataset the p-value generated is 0.05. This does not change the decision to reject the null hypothesis.

The alternative hypothesis is that gender does have an impact on the mean grade obtained by students at these two Portuguese schools. Rejecting the null hypothesis is a disappointing finding in the hope for gender equality.

### Limitations and future directions 

This analysis has two main limitations. First, the study sample is not representative of all students because the data was collected from two Portuguese schools. Hence, it is possible that the statistically significant results may not be generalized to students in other schools and/or countries.

Second, the study does not consider other demographic and social variables such as family size, family income and parents' education that could also impact a student achievement. This means that the results could suffer from omitted variables bias. 

In the future, these limitations could be overcome by performing a multiple linear regression analysis with a more diverse dataset. This approach will estimate whether math grades vary by gender while other explanatory variables are held fixed.

In spite of these limitations, the results are consistent with existing researches findings (Ghazvini and Khajehpour, 2011; Abdu Raheem, 2017)
