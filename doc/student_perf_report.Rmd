## Relationship between gender and math grades.

Our goal of this project is to understand if there is a statistically significant difference in the mean final grade for male and female students in the [UCI Student Performance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). This dataset is comprised of the final math grade achieved in secondary education for two Portuguese schools. Each row in the dataset represents a student. There are two columns in this tibble, sex and final_math_grade. Sex is a categorical variable that contains the value `female` and `male`. final_math_grade is a continous variable that ranges from 0-100, based on the percentage earned by a student.

A sample of this dataset is shown below.

```{r, include=FALSE}
student_math_perf <- read_csv('../data/clean-student-math-perf.csv')
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
head(student_math_perf)
```

More information about the two columns are summarized below. There are 395 students present in this dataset. The final math grade is primarily concentrated between 40%-70%, with a mean of 52%. 

```{r, include=TRUE}
summary(student_math_perf)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Limitations and future directions 

This analysis has two main limitations. First, the study sample is not representative of all students because the data was collected from two Portuguese schools. Hence, it is possible that the statistically significant results may not be generalized to students in other schools and/or countries.

Second, the study does not consider other demographic and social variables such as family size, family income and parents' education that could also impact a student achievement. This means that the results could suffer from omitted variables bias. 

In the future, these limitations could be overcome by performing a multiple linear regression analysis with a more diverse dataset. This approach will estimate whether math grades vary by gender while other explanatory variables are held fixed.

In spite of these limitations, the results are consistent with existing researches findings (Ghazvini and Khajehpour, 2011; Abdu Raheem, 2017)
